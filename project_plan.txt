Project Plan — Popping Bubbles Case Study
Created: 2025-11-22 17:44

=== Instructions (as of 2025-11-22 18:50) ===
- You are a professional portfolio designer and website programmer.
- Review my uploaded files if any, for the latest update I have made.
- Ask me to provide you the latest file if I forgot to upload, as needed.
- Match the same navbar in case-study.html as index.html.
- Remove inline styles from case-study.html; move them into style.css; fix incorrect double curly braces syntax.
- README updates must match the same format and layout; include a version update.
- Project plan must include the user's instructions verbatim so they can be referenced next time.
- Ask for approval before making changes; ask one question at a time.
- Update log, plan, readme.md with my updated instructions (if any), version update, changes and appropriate context.
- Update this plan file on section "Completed tasks" and "Remaining action items" as needed, based on my chat conversation with you.
- Always provide me downloadable files only to the files that have changes made.
- Always ask me review and approval before you made changes to html, css or js files. 
- No approval needed for log, plan, or readme files.
- When documenting privacy and telemetry in the case study, do not describe the data as anonymized; scores and sessions are logged per player-defined username and device id.
- Emphasize my background as a security engineer and highlight privacy-by-design decisions (on-device processing, no image uploads) when expanding the Technology section.
- When we eventually update case-study.html for the Technology section, remember to also bump README.md version and update Version History plus project_log.log and this plan.

Artifacts:
- index.html
- case-study.html
- README.md
- style.css
- script.js
- project_log.log
- project_plan.txt

=== Initial requests ===
Pending actions (need your approval before changes to your repo):
1) Add nav link to case-study.html in index.html after line 29.
2) Upload case-study.html to your portfolio repo and deploy on GitHub Pages.
3) Merge README updates into README.md.
4) Optionally add more images from bubble-game/assets for before/after.

Time estimates:
- Add nav link + deploy: 10–15 min
- Polish visuals/copy in case-study: 30–45 min
- README edits + commit: 10–15 min
- Optional gallery assets: 20–30 min

Notes: Will ask for approval before each change.

=== Completed tasks ===
 1) Add nav link to case-study.html in index.html after line 29.
 2) **User fixed dark-mode TOC colors** for case-study sidebar (links + heading) in `style.css` and confirmed contrast in browser.
 3) Case study hero text updated to reference face-api.js, p5.js, and p5play (copy polish).
 4) Replaced prototype image placeholder with real asset at `/bubble-game/assets/proto_img.png`.
 5) Synced docs: README bumped to **v1.3.5**; plan/log updated accordingly.
 6) Upload `case-study.html` to your portfolio repo and deploy on GitHub Pages.
 7) Merge README updates into `README.md`.
 8) Added optional gallery assets/screenshots throughout case-study.html (research, development journey, solution, blueprint, reflection sections).
 9) Finalized consistent image layout using .img-fixed containers; ensured all figcaptions remain visible; added phone-screenshot class for tall portrait images.
 10) Updated homepage Hero to feature a “Read Case Study” CTA using outline button styling; added dark-theme outline button overrides for consistent black background + purple hover across the site.
 11) Styled the “Live Game” link in the first case-study figure as a button matching project card CTAs; aligned caption heights in artifact galleries using .artifact-gallery min-height.
 12) Improved alt text across case-study images; standardized .artifact-gallery usage; added scroll-margin-top to fix TOC anchor offset; verified consistent outline-button styling in dark theme.
 13) Expanded Technology section in case-study.html to document emotion detection rationale, privacy-by-design camera handling, telemetry with player-defined username + device id, and system architecture (1500 ms face-api.js sampling).
 14) v1.4.6 — Expanded Technology section with emotion/telemetry details, diagrams, and more prominent Tech demo CTA; synced HTML/CSS and later fine-tuned CTA spacing/copy/button style to match outline buttons.
 15) v1.4.7 — Navbar updated to add a Portfolio link on the left, move Case Study to the right, and keep active highlighting consistent across pages.

=== Remaining action items ===
1) (Optional) Future polish: micro-tune copy length in Technology cards if it still feels dense after more user testing.
2) (Optional) Future polish: add small inline notes in README linking directly to the live case-study page and game demo.
